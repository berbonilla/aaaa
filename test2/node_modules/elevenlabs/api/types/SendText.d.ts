     * Use this to attempt to immediately trigger the generation of audio, overriding the `chunk_length_schedule`.
     * Unlike flush, `try_trigger_generation` will only generate audio if our
     * buffer contains more than a minimum
     * threshold of characters, this is to ensure a higher quality response from our model.
     *
     * Note that overriding the chunk schedule to generate small amounts of
     * text may result in lower quality audio, therefore, only use this parameter if you
     * really need text to be processed immediately. We generally recommend keeping the default value of
     * `false` and adjusting the `chunk_length_schedule` in the `generation_config` instead.
